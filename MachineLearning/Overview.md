# Machine Learning Engineering & Operation

- Pipelines: KubeFlow Pipelines, Kedro, MLflow

- Feature Engineering, Feature Store: 
    - Cloud-agnostic: HopsWorks, Feast
    - AWS: SageMaker Feature Store
    - Databricks Feature Store

## Feature Store

Why?
- reuse accross company. Data pipelines to prepare for features are expensive and likely taking too much time of dev.
- help make it simple to standardize feature definition and naming conventions.
- help with model consistency: model built offline and served online from the same features in feature store.
