`enable.idempotence`

* When set to ‘true’, the producer will ensure that exactly one copy of each message is written in the stream. If ‘false’, producer retries due to broker failures, etc., may write duplicates of the retried message in the stream.
* Note that enabling idempotence requires max.in.flight.requests.per.connection to be less than or equal to 5 (with message ordering preserved for any allowable value), retries to be greater than 0, and acks must be ‘all’.

Idempotence is enabled by default if no conflicting configurations are set. If conflicting configurations are set and idempotence is not explicitly enabled, idempotence is disabled. If idempotence is explicitly enabled and conflicting configurations are set, a ConfigException is thrown.
