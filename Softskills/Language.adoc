7 sins of questioning
[start=1]
. Question stacking

    Example: “So, how much testing has been done? I mean, do we really have all the bugs identified? Yeah, I just really think it’s important to know that—are we good to go?”

. Leading questions
    ** Instead, ask questions that assume the other person might be right, not you.
    ** "Tell me about that"
    ** Inquisitive how: how does that align with the requirements?

. Why questions

. Dirty questions. Instead, use
** Tell me more about that.
** What is behind your decision?
** How do you see the issue?

. Dirty questions
** Do you have the courage to stand up to them?
-> clean questions: What do you mean by dead end? What should have happened?

. Binary questions
    -> use what and how questions
. Self-affirming questions
    -> try self-educating questions: what am I missing? what could we do better?
. Aggressive questions
    -> instead of jumping to future, start with present, past, then future


How to collaborate?
[start=1]
. vote first, then discuss
. be curious, not compelling
. invite `dissent` rather than drive `consensus`
. give info, not instructions
    * Instead of “Park there,” try “I see a parking spot there".
    * Instead of “Go ahead and submit the proposal,” try “I can’t see anything I would change.”
    * Instead of “Add these user stories,” try “The product owner has some new user stories for our product.”
    * Instead of “Double-check these numbers,” try “It is important these numbers are correct, and I see something that doesn’t quite add up for me.”


How to move from `compliance` to `commitment`?
[start=1]
. commit to learn, not just do
. commit actions, not beliefs
. chunk it small but do it all
. commitment statements
    * How could we start?
    * How could we test that quickly and cheaply?
    * What is the smallest slice we could make?
    * What can we do?
    * What would that look like?
    * What would a first step look like?
